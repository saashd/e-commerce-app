## Configure Heroku

- [Log in](https://id.heroku.com/login) to your account, or [set up a new one](https://signup.heroku.com/)
- Create a new app on Heroku

### Connect to Github

Next, you can configure deploys with Github. If you prefer to deploy without using Github, you can read [Heroku's deployment documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment).

- In the **Deploy** tab, select the option to **Connect this app to GitHub**
- Select the branch you want to deploy your app from.

### Set Environment Variables
 - edit config vars from your app's Settings tab in the Heroku Dashboard.
###### For this projects add: `MONGO_URL`, `PASS_SEC`, `JWT_SEC`, `STRIPE_KEY` and `CLIENT_ORIGIN`

> ðŸ’¡ You can only connect Heroku apps to a single GitHub repository

## Next steps
More information about all of the configuration steps as well as guidance on maintaining and monitoring your app can be found in [the tutorial](https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/hosting-on-heroku).

If you run into any problems, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/discord/heroku-sample-app/issues) in this repo.

## Configure Netlify

- [Log in](https://app.netlify.com/) to your account, or [set up a new one](https://app.netlify.com/signup)
- In the console, choose `Add new site` and then `Import an existing project` to configure your app.
- Select the `GitHub` provider. Netlify will ask you to authenticate with GitHub.

### Deploy
- For the `Branch to deploy` option, select `deploy`. If you don't have a `deploy` branch
   yet, create one off of `main` so that you can verify the Netlify deployment.
- For the `Build command` option, input whatever command you use to generate
   a build of the site (e.g. `npm run build`).
-  For the `Publish directory` option, input the directory that houses your built
   assets. For React sites, this directory is typically called `build/`.
- Select `Deploy site` and view your deployed site at the link Netlify provides.

### Set Environment Variables
 - edit config vars from your app's Settings tab in the Netlify Dashboard.
###### For this projects add: `MONGO_URL`, `PASS_SEC`, `JWT_SEC`, `STRIPE_KEY` and `CLIENT_ORIGIN`

If your deployment was successful, Netlify will automatically deploy your site
when changes are made to the `deploy` branch.
